# [AssaultCube](https://assault.cubers.net/)

 AssaultCube is an **[open source](https://github.com/assaultcube/AC)**, multiplayer, first-person shooter game, based on the [CUBE engine](http://cubeengine.com/index.php).

Taking place in realistic environments, with fast, arcade gameplay, it's addictive and fun!

With efficient bandwidth usage, it's low-latency and can even run over a 56 Kbps connection.
It's tiny too, weighing in at a lightweight about 50 MB package available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
On the correct settings, it can even run on old hardware (Pentium III and above).

## Why AssaultCube? What is the point?
This is my first working cheat in my life. I followed many Cheat Engine tutorials to achive this and I not just copy-pasted
the base address into the project. My goal is to make a project architecture which will be useful for future cheats
to another games. For example: 
- how to support multiple game versions at the same time
- how to manage the documentation to each game version
- how to update the cheat to each game version
